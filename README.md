First collect a data from kaggle 
clean that data and analyse that data 
then done data preprocessing
model building is done after checking the processing of the algorithm
two files have been made using pickle library
1) vectorizer.pkl which is using tdidf vectorizer method
2) model.pkl which contains the model built using multinomial NB algorithm
with these two files i have created a python file using PyCharm editor and created a website using streamlit
In order to run the website just open the web.py file in any editor and type 'streamlit run web.py' in the terminal .
website will open in the localhost where you can check your Mails/Sms .
